# Sprint1-Scripts-in-Unity
For a personal and team project learning how to make scripts for a 3D game in Unity Game Engine.

Scripts include: Player Movement and Camera Control. Inspired by guided tutorials on YouTube.
# Overview
My files I made personally for a group Game Design project using Unity 3D. The purpose of this project is to become familiar with well known game engines like
Unity Game Engine. I hope to become better trained to write scripts in C# and to fix bugs that occur with them when running the game.
The full repository of the game is found elsewhere, but here you can see my C# scripts I've worked on so far.

The game we plan to make will be a RPG Arena Battle game. The player will start in a generated terrain world with doors to levels scattered about. Each level
will have different challenges to face and will provide opportunities to level up player skills such as Sword, Ranged, and Block skills.

# Development Environment
Developing these scripts used Visual Studio Code 2019, with Unity Editor 2021 as the platform to run and test them.
All programmed in C#

# Useful Websites
Some inspiration goes to the guided tutorials I watched on YouTube:
* [Coding In Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekfio0gfn-Y&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuB5ATsJZLKX3AW4V9XaIV9b&index=4)
* [Dave / Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f473C43s8nE)

# Future Work
* Jumping/forward acceleration midair is a bit too strong
* Better Character model, (one that has a more human hitbox for collisions)
* Crouching Mechanic
